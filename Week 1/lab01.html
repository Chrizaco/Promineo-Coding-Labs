  <!--Then I used H1 as the header tag for the website which is A Trip to Tokyo
I added an image by downloading the .jpg files and creating a relative path

  <!-- I used a main tag to hold the contents of the webpage and organized the 
  structure of the contents by creating multiple sections. Each section has 
  different elements to it such as paragraphs, images, ordered list and 
unordered list. At the end of the code I added a line break and footer. 
All the contents fit within the main tag and the code closes out with 
the body and html tag -->
